// For your IE styles use this import for basic fixes:
//   @import "plonetheme/classic/IEFixes.scss";

// For a plone 3 theme you would use a ploneCustom.scss to put your CSS changes. 
// You should preferrably use this and override the 
// relevant properties you want to change here instead 
// of customizing plone.css to survive upgrades. Writing
// your own plone.css only makes sense for very heavy 
// customizations. Useful variables from Plone are 
// documented at the bottom of this file.
